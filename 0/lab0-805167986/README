Makefile:
This is a file that will allow for compiling of 'lab0' when 'make' is run.
It will do a smoke test when 'make check' is run. This will run many variations of lab0 with
different inputs.

file to file
stdin to stdout
file to stdout
stdin to file

Then it checks for error codes from an unrecognized argument, input failed to open, 
output failed to open, and segfaults.
It will also run a clean of all the extraneous file when 'make clean' is run.
It will compile the tarball when 'make dist' is called so that the program can be turned in.

lab0.c:
This file is the source code for the program which copies stdin to stdout.
It also redirects stdin and stdout depending on arguments which are passed into it.

backtrace.png:
This is a screen shot showing taking of segfault within gdb and backtrace from segfault.

breakpoint.png:
This is a screen shot showing breakpoint stop before fault and inspection of null pointer.

README:
This is this file.

Smoke test cases:
I created files
IN - input file
OUT - output file
BAD - file without any permisions 
DIFF - empty diff file for the diff command

# file to file
./lab0 --input=IN --output=OUT
# after this is run then the diff between IN and OUT should be empty

# stdin to file
./lab0 --output=OUT < IN
# after this is run then the diff between IN and OUT should be empty

# file to stdout
./lab0 --input=IN > OUT
# after this is run then the diff between IN and OUT should be empty

# stdin to stdout
./lab0 < IN > OUT
# after this is run then the diff between IN and OUT should be empty

# unrecognized argument # this should return error code 1
./lab0 --wrong_arg

# unable to open input file # this should return error code 2
./lab0 --input=BAD

# unable to open output file # this should return error code 3
./lab0 --output=BAD

# caught and recieved SIGSEGV # this should return error code 4
./lab0 --catch --segfault
./lab0 --segfault --catch

OTHER INFO:
In make check to pass the P0_check I had to supress the error messages from the
test cases which would give errors and to do this I would put a '-' in front of
each of these commands.
Furthermore, I put an '@' infront of each command so that there would not 
be an output from running any of the make commands unless an error occured.
