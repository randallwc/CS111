Makefile:
This is a file which has 3 options of 'make', 'make clean', and 'make dist'

lab1a.c:
This is a C source code file that will create a full duplex terminal that reads
in chunks of 256 bits and writes each character at a time.  It can pass input and
output between the terminal and the process. It has two options of 
'--shell=program' and '--debug'

README:
This is this file which describes the other files and shows sources

OTHER INFO:
This lab1a takes lab0 and adds the fact that another shell can be echoed.
This means that input can come from the terminal or another program.
I used poll to be able to handle this asynchronous input.
This poll could shut down in 3 ways.

1 - closing the pipe from the keyboard reader
2 - receiving a SIGPIPE from the keyboard reader
3 - receiving an EOF from the shell reader

These 3 ways are also not mutually independent and could happen in any order.
